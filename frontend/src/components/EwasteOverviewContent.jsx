        Understanding E-Waste Collection

      <p className="text-lg md:text-xl text-gray-700 mb-8 leading-relaxed">
        E-waste, or electronic waste, refers to discarded electrical or electronic devices. This includes everything
        from old cell phones and laptops to refrigerators and televisions. As technology rapidly advances and
        consumer electronics become more affordable, the volume of e-waste generated globally is growing at an alarming rate.

            <strong className="font-semibold text-green-900">Environmental Protection:</strong> Electronic devices contain toxic substances like lead, mercury, cadmium, and beryllium. When e-waste is improperly disposed of, these harmful chemicals can leach into the soil and water, contaminating ecosystems and posing severe risks to human health. Recycling prevents this pollution.

          <div>
            <strong className="font-semibold text-green-900">Resource Conservation:</strong> E-waste contains valuable and finite resources such as gold, silver, copper, platinum, and rare earth elements. Recycling these materials reduces the need for virgin resource extraction, conserving natural resources and significantly decreasing energy consumption associated with mining and processing.

          <div>
            <strong className="font-semibold text-green-900">Economic Benefits:</strong> The e-waste recycling industry creates green jobs in collection, sorting, dismantling, and material recovery. Furthermore, recovering valuable materials can provide a steady supply for manufacturing, reducing reliance on imports and stabilizing raw material costs.

          <div>
            <strong className="font-semibold text-green-900">Health and Safety:</strong> Informal e-waste recycling practices in many developing countries often involve burning electronics or using acid baths to extract metals. These dangerous methods expose workers and surrounding communities to toxic fumes and chemicals, leading to severe health problems. Responsible recycling ensures safer practices.
